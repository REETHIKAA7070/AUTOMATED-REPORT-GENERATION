## description

Task 2 of the internship focuses on automating the process of report generation using Python. The main objective of this task is to read data from an external file, analyze the data programmatically, and generate a well-formatted PDF report without manual intervention. Automated report generation is an important concept in software development and data processing, as it helps save time, reduce human errors, and ensure consistency in reporting.

In this task, a simple text file was used as the data source. The file contains structured data in the form of student names and their corresponding marks. Python’s file handling capabilities were used to open, read, and process the contents of this file. Each line of the file was read, split into meaningful components, and converted into appropriate data types for further analysis.

After reading the data, basic analysis was performed on it. The total marks of all students were calculated, and the average marks were derived. This step demonstrates how Python can be used not only to read data but also to perform computations and logical operations on it. Such data analysis forms the foundation for more advanced applications in data science and reporting systems.

Once the data analysis was completed, a PDF report was generated using the ReportLab library. ReportLab is a powerful Python library used for creating PDF documents programmatically. The report includes a title, a list of students with their marks, and the calculated average marks. Text formatting and layout positioning were handled within the program to ensure that the report appears clean, readable, and professional.

The generated PDF report serves as the final output of this task. By simply running the Python script, the entire process—from reading the data file to generating the final PDF—is completed automatically. This demonstrates the effectiveness of automation in handling repetitive reporting tasks.

Through this task, important concepts such as file handling, data processing, use of external libraries, and automated document generation were learned and applied. Task 2 highlights how Python can be used in real-world scenarios to automate reporting workflows and generate professional documents efficiently. Completing this task provided valuable hands-on experience in building practical and useful automation solutions.
